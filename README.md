# NLP_Project_Fake_News_Detector
Fake News Detector — fine-tuned BERT classifier for real vs. fake news; preprocessing with regex &amp; NLTK; evaluation with accuracy, precision, F1 and confusion matrix.


This project fine-tunes a pre-trained Transformer (BERT) to classify news articles as real or fake. It includes end-to-end steps: data collection (Kaggle/IEEE), regex-based string cleaning, tokenization and stopword removal with NLTK, Hugging Face tokenization and model training, and evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and confusion-matrix visualizations.
